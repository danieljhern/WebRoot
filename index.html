          <p>I started my journey in the technology field at an older age than most. Prior to working in the industry I served in the military from 2010 to 2018. The bulk that time was spent as an infantryman in the 101st abn div so my familiarity with tech was isolated to learning just the basics to get by in browsing the internet and playing video games. As I looked for opportunities outside the military, I was fortunate enough to be educated on an opportunity to be trained in system administration through a transition program. Luckily, I was able to earn a position in the field in 2018 to begin my tech journey.</p>
          <p>What I have grown to love about the tech field is that there is an endless depth, everyday is a welcome challenge. The field is always evolving, requiring a constant path to learning. I am eager to continue learning everything I can about information technology, especially programming/development as that is the most daunting to me at the moment :) . The classes and experiences I have had so far have been incredibly rewarding.  </p>
          <p>Outside of school and work I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter. We are on the constant lookout for new places to checkout in Seattle and the surrounding areas. I also enjoy fitness activites. My main pursuits in fitness are powerlifting, conditioning and jiujitsu. Video games are also a passion of mine. Most of my gaming time right now is spent playing OverWatch preparing for OverWatch 2 to drop. </p>
